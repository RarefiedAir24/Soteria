# ✅ Build Progress - Firebase Working!

## Great News!

The build output shows **Firebase is building successfully**:
- ✅ Firebase target building
- ✅ Compilation steps completing  
- ✅ Linking steps completing
- ✅ No "Missing package product" errors

## What This Means

Firebase packages are now:
- ✅ Resolved correctly
- ✅ Building successfully
- ✅ Linking properly

## Next Steps

1. **Let the build continue** - it should complete now
2. **Watch for any remaining errors** (if any)
3. **The rsync errors should be gone** (since we disabled the embed phase)

## If Build Completes Successfully

You're ready to test! The Plaid integration should work.

## If There Are Still Errors

Share the error messages and I'll help fix them. But based on the Firebase build output, things are looking good!

## Summary of Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Fixed Firebase package resolution
2. ✅ Disabled framework embedding for static linking
3. ✅ Updated Podfile to prevent rsync errors
4. ✅ Firebase is now building successfully

**Keep the build running - you're almost there!** 🚀
